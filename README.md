Zamin Iqbal asked on [BlueSky](https://bsky.app/profile/zaminiqbal.bsky.social/post/3kewembn3fg2s
) about figures related to tree shape depending on population growth. I needed a figure as well so coded [this](scripts/). 

-  Exponential growth

![fig pop](figs/fullpop_exponential.png)  
![fig tree](figs/tree_exponential.png)

-  Constant population size

![fig pop](figs/fullpop_constant.png)  
![fig tree](figs/tree_constant.png)

(The size of the population is the average size of the population under exponential growth)
